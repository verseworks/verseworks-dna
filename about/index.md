---
We are a consulting partnership, based in the United Kingdom.  Our operating model has been inspired by the [Crisp DNA](http://dna.crisp.se).

We're  growing and learning, and this site will be updated to reflect our current practices.  We're deeply grateful to our friends at Crisp who have helped us understand how this works in practice.

This is an open source site, forked and adapted from the Crisp DNA describing how we work.
