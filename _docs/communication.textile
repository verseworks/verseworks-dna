h1(content-listing-header sans). Communication

Our *main internal communication channels* are:

* Team Meetings, held about every 6 weeks.
* Twice-weekly synch meetings: "our slack up".
* "Slack":http://www.slack.com for... most things.
* Team mailing list - a single mailing list with everyone on it. .
* "Doodle":http://doodle.com - We use Doodle to agree times, locations and meetings.
* "Trello":http://trello.com

Most decisions are made, and most problems solved, in one of the above forums.

Where we *store info*:
* Google Docs - we used it for almost everything now a days.
* GitHub - a github organization account for shared code and, well, the {{$site.company_name}} DNA that you are reading right now.

How we *communicate with the outside world*:
* Our website - "www.verseworks.com":http://www.verseworks.com
* A mailing list for our customers and course participants, we send information about upcoming courses about once or twice per quarter.
* Twitter - our twitter handle is "@verseworks":https://twitter.com/verseworks/
* "Linkedin":https://www.linkedin.com/company/10070842?trk=prof-exp-company-name
* ... but the biggest channel of communication is of course the personal and informal channels - tweeting, blogging, and talking to friends and customers. Together we have a huge network!
