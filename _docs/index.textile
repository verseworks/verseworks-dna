"verseworks":https://www.verseworks.com is a consulting company based in the United Kingdom. But we aren't a very typical consulting company:

* None of our consultants are employees.
* We have no managers, not even a CEO. Instead we rely on self-organization and transparency. Almost everything is bottom-up, and "anyone can drive any decision":decisions.html.
* verseworks doesn't want to earn money from it's consultants. It is in practice a non-profit company (although not formally so). Consultants "keep most of what they earn":economic-model.html.
* Our "ownership model":ownership-model.html is designed to keep our stock financially worthless. There is no incentive to "cash in".
* Consultants are 100% autonomous. They can do whatever they want (as long as they don't hurt the brand or "our house":what-is-crisp.html), and work as much or as little as they want.

For our clients, we believe that this is interesting because:
* this removes the conflict of interests between the client and the consultancy.
* our consultants can focus on the client, rather than incentives set by the consultancy.
