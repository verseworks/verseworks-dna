h1(content-listing-header sans). Happiness Index

Our primary metric is the {{ site.company_name }} Happiness Index. It's the only thing we systemically measure and follow up. Scale is 1-5.

We are trialling "Happiness Metric":https://www.happinessmetric.com/ to collect and report on the data.

There's pretty strong peer pressure for people to update this, and most of us do. Some every week, others less frequently. But nobody is forced (remember one of our "core values":what-is-verseworks.html is freedom, so nobody forces anyone to do anything). But all in all this gives us a great overview of what's working and what needs to be fixed.

bq. It's worth checking out more detail about "how Crisp do this":http://dna.crisp.se/docs/happiness-index.html - and follow the links to Jeff Sutherland's blog too.

We'll continue to update this page with our own experiences and data about how this works for us.
