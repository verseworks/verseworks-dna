h1. Our business

Formally, {{site.company_name}} doesn't really have a business area. We are consultants and people can do whatever they want. Nothing about our model is specific to any domain or industry.

In practice though, because of our history and the people who happen to work at {{site.company_name}}, we've evolved two main business areas:

# *Agile/Lean coaching and training*. Mostly shorter engagements or part-time.
# *IT Consultancy/Interim Management*.  Primarily around Product Development, DevOps and Delivery Management
