h1(content-listing-header sans). What, and why, is verseworks?

{{ site.company_name }} is a home for IT consultants who value:

* *Integrity* - We are non-exploitative, congruent and transparent.
* *Diversity* - We collaborate with many people who share our values. We share a lifelong passion for learning, improvement and sharing. We recognise there is no one right answer. Innovation, creativity and energy arise through our differences.
* *Freedom* - We work autonomously and are free to choose with whom we work. We are also free to help our clients choose the same.
* *Good citizenship* - Heart over wallet (money isn't the main thing in life)
* *Professionalism* - We genuinely care about solving our customers problems

We believe these values lead to personal happiness as well as business success.

Basically, we're trying to find the magic balance between being an independent consultant (full freedom, no support), and being an employee (little freedom, lots of support).

In geek-terms, {{ site.company_name }} is a "runtime environment for consultants"
