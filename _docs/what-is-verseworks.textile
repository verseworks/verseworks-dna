h1(content-listing-header sans). What is verseworks and why?

*{{ site.company_name }} is a home for IT consultants who value:*

* *Community* - We like to hang out with people who share our values
* *Freedom* - We want to control our own time
* *Competence* - We want to continuously learn
* *Good citizenship* - Heart over wallet (money isn't the main thing in life)
* *Professionalism* - We genuinely care about solving our customers problems

We believe these values lead to personal happiness as well as business success.

Basically, we're trying to find the magic balance between being an independent consultant (full freedom, no support), and being an employee (little freedom, lots of support).

In geek-terms, {{ site.company_name }} is a "runtime environment for consultants" :o)
